        Generate content for 3 psychological assessment games.
        ALL scenarios must be GENERAL — about everyday workplace/life situations, NOT technical.

        ────────────────────────────────────────────
        GAME 1: Cognitive Intelligence Assessment (5 rounds)
        TECHNIQUE: Weighted Single Selection
        ────────────────────────────────────────────
        Each round presents a realistic workplace/life scenario requiring good judgment.
        The user picks the BEST course of action from 4 options.
        Each option has an expert weight reflecting how good the decision is.

        Each round has:
        - "scenario": A realistic workplace or life situation (2-3 sentences)
        - "question": "What is the best course of action?"
        - "options": Array of exactly 4 options, each with:
          - "id" (a/b/c/d)
          - "text": The action description (1-2 sentences)
          - "weight": Expert weight — one of: 100 (best), 70 (good), 40 (mediocre), 10 (poor)
          - "explanation": Brief 1-sentence expert explanation of why this ranks where it does
        - Each round must have exactly one option with weight 100, one with 70, one with 40, one with 10
        - Options must be REAL decisions (not obvious/trick answers)

        ────────────────────────────────────────────
        GAME 2: Focus & Precision Assessment (5 rounds)
        TECHNIQUE: Correct Identification
        ────────────────────────────────────────────
        Each round presents a detailed scenario, process, report, or factual description.
        Then shows 4 claims about the scenario. Only ONE claim is CORRECT, the other 3 are WRONG.
        The user must identify the ONE correct claim.

        Each round has:
        - "scenario": A detailed workplace process, report, or factual description (3-5 sentences with specific details like numbers, dates, names, sequences)
        - "question": "Which of the following claims about the above is CORRECT?"
        - "claims": Array of exactly 4 claims, each with:
          - "id" (a/b/c/d)
          - "text": The claim text
          - "isCorrect": true for the ONE correct claim, false for the 3 wrong ones
        - Make exactly 1 claim correct (isCorrect: true) and 3 wrong (isCorrect: false)
        - Wrong claims should be SUBTLY wrong (changed numbers, swapped details, slight inaccuracies) — NOT obviously false

        ────────────────────────────────────────────
        GAME 3: Curiosity & Learning Mindset Assessment (5 rounds)
        TECHNIQUE: Priority Ranking of Learning Approaches
        ────────────────────────────────────────────
        Each round presents an unfamiliar situation where the user encounters something new.
        The user must RANK 4 learning approaches from "try first" (1st) to "try last" (4th).
        You provide the expert curiosity ranking (the ideal order for a curious learner).

        Ranking guide (most curious → least curious):
        - Hands-on exploration / experimentation → rank highest
        - Deep independent research / documentation → rank second
        - Asking mentors / seeking external guidance → rank third
        - Avoiding / sticking with what's familiar → rank lowest

        Each round has:
        - "scenario": An unfamiliar situation where the user encounters something new (2-3 sentences)
        - "question": "How would you prioritize these approaches?"
        - "approaches": Array of exactly 4 approaches, each with:
          - "id" (a/b/c/d)
          - "text": The learning approach description
        - "expertRanking": Array of approach IDs in ideal curiosity order [most curious → least curious]
          e.g. ["b", "d", "a", "c"] means approach B is most curious, C is least
